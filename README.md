This repository is dedicated to the predictive analysis of West Nile Virus spread. 

West Nile Virus (WNV) is a potentially serious viral illness transmitted primarily by mosquitoes. In the case of the city of Chicago, Illinois, where mosquito-borne diseases pose a significant public health concern, authorities have implemented a comprehensive strategy to track and understand the prevalence of WNV. By deploying a network of traps throughout the city, they collect mosquitoes and subsequently analyze the captured specimens to gain insights into the spread of the virus.

This project starts by understanding and exploring the data. I uncovered patterns of mosquito counts over time, studied the prevalence of West Nile Virus (WNV) across mosquito species, and analyzed how mosquito counts varied by trap type. `Visual aids` helped present key takeaways clearly. Digging deeper, I computed average mosquito counts each month, compared WNV occurrence across species and dived into the `correlations` between different variables. I assessed the significance of these connections, grounding my insights in solid `statistics`. Moving forward, I developed models: a `linear regression` for predicting mosquito numbers and a `logistic regression` to understand WNV presence. My documentation wrapped it all up, revealing valuable mosquito behavior insights and shedding light on WNV transmission dynamics. I showcased connections uncovered through `rigorous analysis`, and how these models enriched our comprehension of mosquito counts and the elusive presence of WNV.
